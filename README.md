# Welcome to your TrueAlign project

## Core Idea: Matching on How Values Are Lived

The TrueAlign app goes beyond asking users to list values like "honesty" or "family." Instead, it uncovers how those values guide their decisions and behaviors—mimicking the way shared activities naturally reveal alignment. The focus is on creating matches that spark long, engaging conversations and feel as organic as meeting someone through a community or hobby.

### Step 1: Capturing Values in Action

To get at real value alignment, we need a way to see how users prioritize and apply their values in life. Here’s the plan:

**Scenario-Based Questions**

Present users with situations that force them to show their values in action.  
Example: "Your partner wants to take a big financial risk for a dream project, but you prefer security. How do you handle it?"  
Options might reflect stability vs. ambition, showing what matters most to them.

**Value Narratives**

Ask users to share a short story about a time their values shaped a big decision.  
Example: "Tell us about a moment when your sense of fairness changed how you acted."

**Value Trade-Offs**

Have users rank their values by making tough choices.  
Example: "In a relationship, is trust more important than independence?"

### Step 2: Matching That Reflects Real Alignment

The matching system won’t just count shared values; it’ll focus on how those values are prioritized and lived, ensuring matches feel natural and conversation-ready:

**Weighted Value Matching**

Users tag their "deal-breaker" values (e.g., loyalty or growth), and the algorithm prioritizes matches where these align strongly.

**Behavioral Compatibility**

Using scenario responses, the app checks if two people would act similarly in value-driven moments.  
Example: If both choose family over career in a scenario, they’re a stronger match.

**Conversation Hooks**

Matches highlight shared values and complementary ones to spark discussion.  
Example: If both value communication but differ on risk-taking, that’s a talking point.

### Step 3: A Design That Sparks Deep Conversations

The app’s interface will push users past small talk and into meaningful dialogue, reflecting the organic flow of community-based connections:

**Value-Focused Profiles**

Show each user’s top values, a snippet from their narrative, and how they answered a scenario.  
Example: "They value trust and once stood by a friend in crisis—ask them about it!"

**Tailored Conversation Starters**

Give prompts tied to their alignment.  
Shared value: "You both care about integrity—what does that look like in your life?"  
Difference: "You lean toward adventure, they prefer routine—how could that work?"

**Interactive Prompts**

Offer mini-scenarios for matches to discuss.  
Example: "You win a surprise weekend trip—how do you decide what to do?"

### Making It Practical

**Free to Start:** Basic matching and a few prompts are free, keeping it open to everyone.  
**Premium Option:** Pay for extras like filtering by specific values or getting detailed compatibility breakdowns.  
**Engagement Boost:** Weekly value-reflection questions (e.g., "How did kindness show up for you this week?") keep users active and deepen their profiles.

### Why This Beats the Status Quo

Meeting people through work or hobbies works because you see their values in action—how they collaborate, problem-solve, or show up consistently. This app recreates that by focusing on lived principles, not just stated preferences. It’s designed to feel natural, foster real conversations, and lead to partnerships grounded in alignment—just like those organic connections you’re aiming for.
